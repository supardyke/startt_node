Easy steps on starting a node js project to creating your first app

This part of the process is always skipped or looked down on making it difficult for newbies to even be interested in developing NODE.JS apps

This tutorial is for those that already have the latest version of nodejs installed on their PC

And ensure your version has NPM as part of it.

For those not sure, Kindly run this command on your CMD

CMD simply means your command line, Linux users already use this alot

node -v

it should return the nodejs version, mine is v8.11.1

then npm -v

it should return the npm version, mine is 5.6.0

And npm stands for Node Package Manager, please do not ask me why i use npm because i just love it

OK lets proceed


I will guide you through the steps

You need not worry, its easy as ABC

Step 1.) Create your directory for the project, say nodeapp

Step 2.) Run this command on your CMD npm init, you will be prompted with some questions step by step

		a.) Package name: this is the name you wish to call your project,mine will be nodeapp

		b.) Version: this is current version of your project, i will use 0.0.1 since am not launching yet but you can chhose any version 	you want 1.1.0

		c.) Description: this is a brief description of your project, so other people can read and understand what your project is about

		d.) Package name: this is the name you wish to call your project

		e.) Entry point: this is the first file that node should run one the app starts, mine is index.js

		f.) Test command: this command is run for npm test, its for those using continious integration tools, to dest the app before 		deployment

		g.) Git repository: this is the git repository for your project

		h.) Keywords: I think this is self explanatory however for simplicity its the words that are related to your project such as node 		etc

		i.) Author: this the name of the owner of the app which is you, mine is supardyke :)

		j.) License: this is the license you want your app to be under, kindly go through the popular ones to know which you want,i use 	MIT but there is ISC, APACHE etc

		k.) You will then be shown all your input with an is this ok prompt, go through and if its OK kindly say yes and viola we are 		set, notice you now have a package.json file in the root directory of your project, SCREAM YES I DID IT :)


Step 3.) Now create your index.js file for those that used it as their entry point, while those that did not should create a file after their entry point.

Step 4.) Kindly go over to my repository on node for beginners and see how to write my first nodejs app.
